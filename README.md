# GameMaker-Scripts
Scripts that I made for GameMaker. You can use them in your project however you want.

A simple and fast script that will return if any audio is playing at the moment


## Hebrew Text
![icon](/Hebrew%20Text/Icon.jpg)

Use the script `HE_draw_text(x, y, string)` in order to draw Hebrew text.
* The script draws from right to left (No need to set again the Halign after the script)
* The script uses the font `ftHE`(Arial with Hebrew letters)
* The script uses the script `HE_string_reverse`

## Get Username windows
